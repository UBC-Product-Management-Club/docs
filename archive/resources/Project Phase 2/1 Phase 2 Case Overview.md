## **Overview:**

In Phase 1, you suggested a single improvement to your favourite product. Now, you will be partnering up and selecting one product to bring to a new or specific segment of the current market. For example:

"LinkedIn Coffee Chats" (1) → "LinkedIn for Students" (2)"Grammarly Translations" (1) → "Grammarly for Language Learners" (2)

Rather than just considering a user problem and proposing a solution, you will now be considering the needs of the company and the competitive landscape. These are real-world conditions that a product manager must consider.

**Case:**

> Re-purpose an existing product for a new market segment.

**Steps:**

1. **Proposal**: Company, Market, OKRs
2. **Market Research:** Industry, Competitors, Customer
3. **Strategy**: Roadmap, Go-to-Market Strategy
4. **Design**: Hi-Fidelity Prototype
5. **Conclusion**: Risks & Mitigation, Learnings

**Exemplars:**

- **[LinkedIn for Students](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lg0hxH6LNdvcTZORQmR3wUJRVYSDTjQ1/view)** (longer than expected for Phase 2)
