# 2.4 Design

1. **[Design & Prototyping](https://community.ubcpm.club/resources/post/2-4-design-wJJKDodkzz3AuIV)** Brainstorm solutions on pen and paper and then bring your ideas to life with a dynamic Figma prototype

For this section, we want you to create a dynamic prototype in Figma. We recommend you start with a quick pen-and-paper sketch as it is easy to revise. Once you feel comfortable with your product requirements and sketch, begin designing in Figma!

Refer back to phase 1 for learning resources on product requirements and visual mockups: [Phase 1 Design](https://community.ubcpm.club/curriculum/1-4)

Here is an article going over Figma prototypes. This is a good place to start, but we recommend you watch some tutorial videos if you are new to the tool: [Figma Guide](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040314193-Guide-to-prototyping-in-Figma)

## Your Tasks

- Create a list of product requirements as done in Phase 1
- Pen and Paper sketch of your design
- Figma prototype
