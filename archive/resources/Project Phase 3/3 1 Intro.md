Companies get stuck in the build trap when they are so focused on shipping features and developing cool ideas that they don't think about the outcome of those features and the actual value that they produce. The build trap causes companies to measure their success in terms of outputs rather than outcomes. They stop producing real value for their users, lose market share, and are vulnerable to disruption. A prime example of this is Kodak, which doubled down on how it had always done things, instead of responding to the challenge of digital photography.

For a more indepth understanding of the build trap, you can check out this article which is a high level summary of the well known book:
