> Watch video from 5:00 to 48:00 and take notes!

The problem space (or "opportunity space") is an abstract landscape of who your users are and a description of their needs, pain points, and desires. In this video, you will understand why it it is essential to explore the problem space before jumping into solutions and what you can do to learn more about your users' problems.

## **Your Task**

- Conduct some informal research of your user which will help you create your User Persona and Map of the Opportunity Space.
  - Interview or chat with a few people you know that use the product.
  - If applicable, look at online forums (e.g. Reddit, Quora, company forums) to hear from your products' users or potential users.

# \***\*Create a User Persona\*\***

_This page is a summarized, cut-down version of this article: [https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-research/putting-personas-to-work-in-ux-design/](https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/process/user-research/putting-personas-to-work-in-ux-design/)_

User personas are archetypical users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users (a "segment").

Usually, a persona is presented in a one or two-page visual (see below). This document may include behavior patterns, goals, skills, attitudes, and background information, as well as the environment in which a persona operates. Designers usually create user persona template templates, which include a few fictional personal details to make the persona a realistic character (e.g. quotes of real users), as well as context-specific details (for example, for a banking app it makes sense to include a persona’s financial sophistication and major expenses).

## **Your Task**

1. **Collect the information about your users.** Talk to your users, get to know their background, or read what they say in online forums (e.g. Reddit or Quora).
2. **Create a user persona.** You can create multiple, but you will only focus on a single persona for your project.
   1. "During this step, it’s best to avoid the temptation to add a lot of personal details: one or two bits of personality can bring a persona to life, but too many details will be distracting and will make the persona less credible as an analytical tool. Don Norman put it this way: '[personas] only need to be realistic, not real, not necessarily even accurate (as long as they accurately characterize the user base).'"
3. **Describe scenario(s) of the user persona.**
   1. "Personas have no value in and of themselves. They become valuable only when they tied up to a scenario. A scenario is an imagined situation that describes how a persona would interact with a product in a particular context to achieve its end goal(s)."
   2. "Scenarios should be written from the persona’s perspective, usually at a high level, and articulate use cases that will likely happen."

## **Templates**

# \***\*Opportunity Mapping\*\***

## **Reading**

Read this article (written by Teresa Torres, author of Continuous Discovery Habits) about mapping the opportunity space:

---

## **Takeaways**

- Approach the opportunity space in this order: Outcome → Opportunity (user needs, pain points, desires) → Smaller Sub-Opportunities.
- You can use the top half of an "Opportunity-Solution tree" to map the opportunity space. Some opportunities are part of larger opportunities.
- Prioritize opportunities before even thinking about solutions.

---

## **Your Task: Map the Opportunity Space**

Start creating your opportunity-solution tree:

- Include your Outcome at the top, which is some form of your hypothesis from your Project Proposal.
- Think about the User Persona you created and write out opportunities (needs, pain points, desires) and more specific sub-opportunities.
- Don't think about solutions yet.

## **Templates**

Here is a visual template that you can make a copy of or use as inspiration:
