# Case Overview

**How would you improve your favourite product? Design a new feature for your favourite software product by incorporating design and prioritization methods.**

The favourite product question [is a classic](https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/product-manager/favorite-product-interview-question) in product manager interviews. We're taking a more in-depth approach to this question in a longer, case study format.

This phase is meant to provide a surface-level understanding of product management: **your goal is design a solution that solves a user's problem, but we do not expect intensive strategic thinking or validation of solutions.** These advanced topics will be introduced in Phase 2 & 3.

## **Steps**

1. **Project Proposal.** Describe the situation, assumptions, and your objective for improving the product.
2. **User Research.** Consider a single user persona, research user opinions online, talk to a few friends about the product, then describe their needs, pain points, and desires.
3. **Solution.** Brainstorm ideas that solve the user's needs, pain points, and desires. Then, prioritize your ideas using a framework that weighs user value and effort to hone in on your solution's core value proposition and benefits.
4. **Design.** Describe product requirements, then create a wireframe (low-fidelity mock-up) of your solution using Figma.
5. **Conclusion.** Describe trade-offs, risks, and learnings.

At each step, you will be required to submit to the relevant section of community.ubcpm.club for peer and mentor feedback. You will have written and revised most of your final case study write-up by step 5 that you will then publish to your portfolio.

## **Examples**

We recommend using these exemplars as a reference point for what a long-term project could look like. These were developed with more than 2 weeks' time; your research does not have to be as thorough and your design not as elegant.
