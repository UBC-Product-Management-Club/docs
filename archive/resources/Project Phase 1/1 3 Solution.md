# 1.3 Solution

## **Step 3: Solution**

1. **[Solution Ideation](https://community.ubcpm.club/curriculum/1-3/post/solution-ideation-O3Du4TsZwWYXV23)** Read this page, then complete the task of brainstorming solutions. Your solution ideas will be based on the opportunities (user problems) you identified in the User Research step.
2. **[Feature Prioritization](https://community.ubcpm.club/curriculum/1-3/post/feature-prioritization-EdrtANyEmHKorLI)** Watch the included video and take notes! Then, complete the task of using a prioritization framework.
3. **[Value Proposition](https://community.ubcpm.club/curriculum/1-3/post/value-proposition-At35aZPsa28U3lM)** Put the core benefits of your solution into words.

To complete **Step 3: Solution**, create a post below that includes:

1. Some of the solution ideas you brainstormed
2. Prioritization framework showing solution ideas
3. Your value proposition

# Value Proposition

You've successfully identified your customer and their problems, brainstormed and prioritized solution ideas, but now you have to communicate what you've decided will be most valuable to the user!

## What is a Value Proposition?

[Value Proposition](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/value-proposition/)

> Answer this question: How does your product or service solve your customer’s problem?

## **Your Task**

- Describe the value proposition of your overall solution. What benefits does it provide to your user? How does it solve the user's problem?
  - List the benefits (these may correlate 1:1 with opportunities)
  - Write your value proposition as one sentence if you can! (How would you describe the overall solution succinctly to a user?)

### Introduction

Now that you've mapped out the "opportunity space" in [Step 2](https://community.ubcpm.club/curriculum/1-2), you are ready to start thinking about **solutions**. Typically, this is a collaborative process between PMs, designers, and engineers. For the sake of this project, you can brainstorm solutions on your own or with your group.

The best way to think about solutions is to start with the problem, which you have already done. Use your User Persona and Opportunity Map to consider the needs, pain points, and desires of a specific user segment, then generate a list of ideas for how you can solve them.

If there are certain opportunities that you do not want to prioritize, there is no need to write solutions for them.

## **Generating Solutions for the *Right* Problem**

_This section is part of an article from Harvard Business Review. You can find the whole post here: [Link](https://hbr.org/2017/01/are-you-solving-the-right-problems)_

**The Slow Elevator Problem**

Imagine this: You are the owner of an office building, and your tenants are complaining about the elevator. It’s old and slow, and they have to wait a lot. Several tenants are threatening to break their leases if you don’t fix the problem.

When asked, most people quickly identify some solutions: replace the lift, install a stronger motor, or perhaps upgrade the algorithm that runs the lift. These suggestions fall into what I call a solution space: a cluster of solutions that share assumptions about what the problem is—in this case, that the elevator is slow. This framing is illustrated below.

![https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2016/11/R1701D_WEDELL_PROBLEMFRAMING_A.png](https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2016/11/R1701D_WEDELL_PROBLEMFRAMING_A.png)

However, when the problem is presented to building managers, they suggest a much more elegant solution: Put up mirrors next to the elevator. This simple measure has proved wonderfully effective in reducing complaints, because people tend to lose track of time when given something utterly fascinating to look at—namely, themselves.

![https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2016/11/R1701D_WEDELL_PROBLEMFRAMING_B.png](https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2016/11/R1701D_WEDELL_PROBLEMFRAMING_B.png)

The mirror solution is particularly interesting because in fact it is not a solution to the stated problem: It doesn’t make the elevator faster. Instead it proposes a different understanding of the problem.

Note that the initial framing of the problem is not necessarily wrong. Installing a new lift would probably work. The point of reframing is not to find the “real” problem but, rather, to see if there is a better one to solve. In fact, the very idea that a single root problem exists may be misleading; problems are typically multicausal and can be addressed in many ways. The elevator issue, for example, could be reframed as a peak demand problem—too many people need the lift at the same time—leading to a solution that focuses on spreading out the demand, such as by staggering people’s lunch breaks.

Identifying a different aspect of the problem can sometimes deliver radical improvements—and even spark solutions to problems that have seemed intractable for decades.

## **Your Task: Generate Solutions**

Prioritize the opportunities you want to brainstorm solutions for, then write as many as you can identify. In the case of software, a solution is usually a "feature," but it might also some other kind of change or removal to the app.

- For each opportunity in your opportunity map that you want to prioritize, generate a list of solutions.
  - There are no "bad" ideas in a brainstorm. Write them all down! You will cut and prioritize later.
  - Adjust your opportunity map if you think some of the opportunities (problems) should be rephrased to help you find other solutions to the "Slow Elevator" problem.

How do you prioritize product features and solutions? What are the best frameworks and methodologies to use? This video addresses those questions.

## **Your Task**

- Choose a prioritization framework and apply it to the ideas you generated.
  - To determine "effort" or "complexity," consider talking to your developer friends.
- Create a visual that you can embed in your case study.

## **Template**

Since you will be choosing your own prioritization framework, we're providing a range of templates here: [https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/templates/feature-prioritization](https://www.aha.io/roadmapping/guide/templates/feature-prioritization)
