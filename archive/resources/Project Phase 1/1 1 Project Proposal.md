# 1.1 Project Proposal

## **Step 1: Fellowship Project Post**

1. **Choose an existing software product in the current market and explain why it's a favourite of yours.** When selecting a favourite software product, choose something you are passionate about and love to talk about. Then, describe your unique perspective on the product. We recommend that you choose a [B2C product](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-b2b-and-b2c/), or a product where you have easy access to user opinions.
2. **Consider problems you or other users have encountered when using the product.**
3. **Describe the situation, assumptions, and your objective.** What is the product? What are you trying to achieve by improving it?
