# 1.4 Design

## **Step 4: Design**

1. **[Product Requirements](https://community.ubcpm.club/curriculum/1-4/post/optional-hi-fidelity-prototyping-uX8uAkNk4Wyc1JM)** Learn about product requirements documents (PRDs) then write out requirements for your design.
2. **[Visual Mockup](https://community.ubcpm.club/curriculum/1-4/post/prd-iWbJVsZFHb4g7J5)** Read the brief description and choose how you want to design your initial mockup. Complete the task at the end of the page.
3. **[Hi-Fidelilty Prototyping](https://community.ubcpm.club/curriculum/1-4/post/prd-lWk6Jd0THRF4g7X)** -> **Optional!** Watch the included Figma workshop tutorial to get a better sense of how to use the software. As this stage is optional, you can go as in-depth as desired.

To complete **Step 4: Design**, create a post below that includes:

1. List of product requirements
2. Your visual mockup

# Product Requirements

Read this article from Productboard for a brief introduction to the purpose and contents of a product requirements document:

## **Your Task**

No need to create a full PRD. Your full written case study acts as a PRD, in a way. But you should describe the details of your solution is before you start designing it!

- Write out a list or description of requirements for your design. (It's best to phrase this from the user's perspective.)

# Visual Mockup

The purpose of an initial mockup is to visualize your solution and gauge what a final design might include. Sometimes, as you sketch out an idea, new challenges might present themselves. That's why it's important to draw out how your solution works before providing them to developers.

It's typical for designers (or in some cases, PMs) to create "low-fidelity" designs before fully coloured, pixel-perfect ("high-fidelity") prototypes. That's because a sketch only takes a few seconds whereas a full design takes several hours.

It's your turn to decide between creating a sketch (low-fidelity) or digital mockup (medium-fidelity):

## **Option 1: Pen & Paper**

No need for design software! If you are a product manager and can actually draw out your ideas instead of just speaking them, designers will appreciate you *a lot* more.

Here's a paper sketch from the [LinkedIn Coffee Chats exemplar](https://milap3.medium.com/linkedin-coffee-chats-a11a5dada217):

## **Option 2: Figma (or your own design software)**

Want to take your design up a notch? Create a visual design using Figma, Miro, Balsamiq, or some other design software. Figma is typically the platform of choice by UX Designers.

Here's a medium-fidelity mockup from the [LinkedIn Coffee Chats exemplar](https://milap3.medium.com/linkedin-coffee-chats-a11a5dada217):

## **Your Task**

- Choose whether you want to do your visual mockup on paper or Figma. There is no right choice here. However, in the next two phases, you will be required to create more comprehensive designs using Figma.
- Design your pen & paper sketch or digital medium-fidelity mockup.
  - You should include any new features or changes to your favourite product and how they will be integrated into the existing user interface.
  - Designing is an iterative process! Sometimes it takes several tries to get the right result. Take a look at [the Stitcher example](https://community.ubcpm.club/curriculum/1-4/post/example-stitcher-uVGnRyGtXWZhyw4).
- Upload your design as an image and write a few sentences to describe it.

# (Optional) Hi-Fidelity Prototyping

If you want, you can upgrade your visual mockup to a higher-fidelity design. This can be done in Figma or similar design software.

If you want to learn Figma, this workshop from a PMC alum is a great place to start:
