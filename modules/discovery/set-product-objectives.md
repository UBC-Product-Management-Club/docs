# Setting Product Objectives
### Session slide deck can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/195HzAGZzUaEDCJWV-79bGB8GjFlI37OY/view?usp=sharing) (combined with previous session)

### Session Key Points:

- Now that you understand and prioritized the problems to target, it is important to set clearer product objectives: who are we serving (user personas), how will the product be used (use cases), what are we trying to accomplish (core values), and how do we judge the success of our product (success metrics) 
- **Creating user personas**
  - a user persona is a semi-fictional character based on your current (or ideal) customer
  - user personas are created using demographic insights from your user research and give a realistic example of a customer
  - User personas are important because they allow for you to actualize the type of person your product is for, and cater all efforts to serving that type of person
  - There are various levels of detail that can go into a user persona, but the 3 main questions that must be answered in one is:
    - Who are they? (work, hobbies, personality, family situation, anything that may be relevant)
    - What is their main goal? (what are they currently wanting/trying to do that they are having difficulties with)
    - What is their main barrier to achieving that goal?
  
- **Identifying use cases**
  - Based on your user personas, identify the situations where your product will be used, ensuring a clear understanding of what circumstances you must cater your product features to
  - A use case is written from the user’s perspective, and involves a list of actors, their goals, the steps they need to take to achieve them, and the scenarios they may encounter, They can also include a list of ways the product will be interacted with
  - These use cases allow for a product team to recognize the requirements for their product and the circumstances in which the product features need to be helpful
  
- **Formulating core values**
  - In accordance with your brand and mission, formulating your core product values regarding your mission, and your broader vision for developing products in a certain space are strong ways to attract customers and partnerships, while keeping your efforts focused as well
    
- **Outlining success metrics (aka KPIs)**
  - Once you reach a beta-testing stage, success metrics are what you track to judge success of your product at that stage
  - Examples: conversion rate, churn rate, monthly recurring revenue,
  - Product metrics, sometimes called key performance indicators (KPIs), are quantifiable data points that an organization tracks and analyzes to gauge a product’s success
  - These metrics all tie back to the product strategy: what the goals of the product are, and the contexts they are being used in
  - Using generic product metrics are often unhelpful and don’t give insights into the success of the product, so it is important to use metrics relevant to the product/user and context at hand
