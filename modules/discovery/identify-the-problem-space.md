# Identifying the Problem Space

### Session slide deck can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TwHtrEN_IJC1uedJZI8qiGIwYy5AyaMa/view?usp=sharing).

### Session Key Points:
- What is a **problem space**?
  - A problem space is the set of problems your product can solve
  - A problem space is defined by working through an issue and defining a problem, including its surrounding aspects
  - This process does not focus on the symptoms of the problem, but on finding the root problem itself, which is what the ‘problem space’ encompasses
- **This is NOT the time to think of potential solutions**, to think about implementation at this point will constrain your thinking to what can be solved rather then what should be solved
- Identify high-level objectives:
  - Based on your understanding of the problem space, what should a product in this space accomplish
  -	Begin to identify a solution space, a set of all solutions that solve a given problem, researching existing products aiming to solve the problem of interest and other adjacent problems
- Identify the types of challenges/problems
  - Problems can be more lack/need oriented, or accelerating/growth oriented
    - Is a problem about filling a gap, making something possible that previously wasn’t possible
    - Or is it accelerating an existing process, making it more efficient, etc.
- Ensuring your ability to address that problem space
  -	Are you experiencing the identified problems yourself? Or just have ties to others that do?
  -	What expertise/perspective are you bringing to approach solving these problems?
  -	It is important to ask these questions and identify gaps in the team
    -	Some gaps can be filled, but too many may need a shift in the scope of problems being approached
