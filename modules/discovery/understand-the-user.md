# Understanding the User
### Session slide deck can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nktm_W18P51vKTY0JOIghOvt79NsZVuL/view?usp=sharing)

### Session Key Points:
- What is User Research, and why is it important?
  - User research is used to understand the user’s needs, behaviours, experience, and motivations in order to inform the process of solving that user problem
  - Great UX design is grounded in great user research, driven by user insights while prioritizing features in consideration of technical feasibility
  - By collaborating with users, we can take a **user-centred design** approach, increasing the likelihood of a successful product/feature in the end by bringing our end users into our design process
    
- How would you approach this research?
  - It is important to take an empathetic approach to user research, putting aside your own assumptions about the problem space and users, and simply letting the insights and perspectives drive themselves
  - Extensive user research will automatically begin to reveal the understanding you need to begin moving forward with your design
    
- Not doing user research can result in a seemingly polished and useful product never getting adopted, since it doesn’t actually hit the mark on what the users need or how they would use it
  
- There are a variety of user research methods (often times multiple methods are used in tandem):
  - **User interviews (our focus)** - interviewing a sample from the demographic being targeted
  - **Contextual observations** - observing user activity in an environment that can give clues to their natural needs/challenges
  - **Data collection** - collecting data on the target demographic
  -	**User testing** - Allowing users to test a product prototype in a controlled environment
    
- How to conduct effective user interviews
  - Ask **open-ended questions**, not Yes/no questions
  - Don’t ask directed or leading questions, be neutral
  - **User’s don’t know what they want**, ask questions that them questions about their behaviour/implications of a problem, so you can hone in on the problem yourself
  - Don’t make assumptions, ask the seemingly obvious questions (wrong assumptions can undermine the entire interview results)
  - Don’t introduce biases by mentioning what other users think
    
- Analyzing interview results:
  - ‘translate’ responses into insights about their needs/behaviours
    - This is important due to the ‘users don’t know what they want’ point above, so make sure to draw a connection between a response given and hypotheses you had coming into the interview, or making note of a new insight entirely
  - In the end, synthesize your notes and responses to questions, and draw the insights that are best supported based on those results, these insights will indicate whether more user-research (perhaps of another type) is needed
