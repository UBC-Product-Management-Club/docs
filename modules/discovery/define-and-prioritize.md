# Defining and Prioritizing
### Session slide deck can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/195HzAGZzUaEDCJWV-79bGB8GjFlI37OY/view?usp=sharing) (combined with next session)

### Session Key Points:

- Now that you have understood your user, it is time to nail down the problem you wish to target
  -	aim to have a one-sentence statement that covers the entirety of the problem you want to solve
  -	this helps you communicate the cause clearly and make sure team members are all on the same page
  -	Formulating this problem statement loosely will make it difficult to keep efforts focused on where they need to be
    
- Clearly validate your problem based on your user research
  -	make sure the problem you are targeting actually needs to be solved
  -	Two critical questions must have concrete answers in order to validate your problem:
    -	How big is the pain users are experiencing?
    -	How much value will tackling the problem truly add?
  -	If you cannot answer these questions extensively, you may need to:
    -	do more user research
    -	pivot the problem you are targeting
    -	and sometimes both!
      
- Prioritizing your validated problems is a critical step in launching a product
  -	prioritize the parts of the problem that are the central parts and must be tackled first 
  -	You must account for the value solving that problem brings, the complexity of solving the problem, the time horizon of developing a solution to that problem, and the resources needed for the process
  -	there are multiple frameworks used by product teams to do this, but a simple one is the value vs complexity framework, though the RICE and ICE methods are also very popular
    
- Value vs complexity framework:
