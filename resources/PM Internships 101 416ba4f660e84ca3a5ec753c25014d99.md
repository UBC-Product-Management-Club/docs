## Key Tips

- Apply Early; Not Perfect
    
    It’s crucial to keep you resume consistently updated so you can take advantage of opportunities as they come. With internships being so competitive recruiters simply don’t have the time to find the “best applicant.” They are looking for someone with a fairly relevant background who has a good attitude and seems trainable.
    
- Linkedin Job Alerts
    
    The only way to ensure you’re applying early is to be aware of the job posting that are available at any point in time. Here are some ways LinkedIn job alert prompts that might help:
    
    - [Management Intern](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?keywords=management+intern&distance=25&geoId=101330853)
    - [Analytics Internship](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?keywords=analytics+internship&distance=25&geoId=101174742)
    - [Consulting Internship](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?keywords=consulting+internship&distance=25&geoId=101174742)
    - [Product Internship](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?keywords=product+internship&distance=25&geoId=90009553)
    - [Product Management Intern](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?keywords=product+management+intern&distance=25&geoId=101174742)
    - [Operations Intern](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?keywords=operations+intern&distance=25&geoId=102095887)
- Use [Simplify.ai](https://simplify.jobs/)
    
    This platform allows you to speed up your application by auto-filling common fields like your resume, work experience and demographics.
    
- Learn How to Google
    
    Googling with “” and using site:
    
- Resume Tips
    
    Resume Bullet Point Tips
    
    - Adding quantitative metrics by considering the expected business value of any projects you’ve done
    - Make sure you’ve answered Who, What, Where, Why and How?
        - Who… did this project/experience effect?
        - What… did you contribute to its completion and success?
        - Why… is it important? This is where you quantify impact through numbers that you can estimate.
        - Where… can I (the recruiter) learn more?
        - How… how did you go about executing the initiative and overcoming hurdles?
    
    **Generally Accepted Resume Practices things to consider - in no particular order:**
    
    - Highlight your expected graduation date as opposed to your start date - eligibility purposes
    - Showcase coursework with descriptive names that suggest relevant skills
    - Use bold sparingly - really only need to bold tech skills, PM words and numbers; I would stray away from bolding adjacent words because you’ve already drawn attention to that area
    - Try to have one sentence, per bullet, per line that extends all the way end with a period at the end (semicolons are your friend) - universally accepted practice
        - You want to use your space efficiently and having, for ex. 3 words on one line isn’t the best allocation of that space
    - Be strategic about the keywords you use and where. Having the same word multiple times has diminishing returns because the ATS picks up on it the first time; this is unless you really want to highlight that capability.
        - To help with this, I read job descriptions pretty religiously and learn + use the keywords I see
    - Try to use less conversational language, resume bullet points are a bridge between colloquial language and succinct points
    - For ex. Instead of “Implemented a client request tracking system to prioritize feature development, resulting in more efficient and user-centered product development. Created user stories with weighted importance to guide the engineering team’s product backlog that eventually received 90% user usage in production”…..
        - I might say: Streamlined and prioritized the development of an overlooked client request tracking system in backlog with a 90% customer utilization rate that improved UX by ____% based on weighted user stories
    
    More than anything, it’s important to apply EARLY rather than perfect. Recruiters aren’t looking for the perfect applicant, they’re looking for a teachable one with limited hiring manager hours.

## Research

- Company
- Market
- Clients
- Current Events

## Types of Questions

- Behavioural
    
    This is not unique to PM interviews. As with most interviews, these questions are designed for interviewers to get to know you better. The goal of the interviewee should be to highlight their past experience which is relevant to Product Management even if they haven't worked as a PM before. This includes questions about, but not limited to:
    
    - your past experience
    - your interest in the role
    - your interest in the company
- Product Design
    
    These questions typically assess your ability to reason about designing products/product features. Since this is one of the primary roles of a PM it is important to familiarize yourself with different products. Examples include:
    
    - How would you design product X for Y people?
    - What is your favourite product and how will you improve it?
    - How would you improve Netflix/Facebook/Dropbox/Zoom/[Insert Product]?
- Strategy
    
    Product strategies outline a vision for product offerings. As a PM it is your responsibility to set clear goals, expectations and roadmaps for the final product. These questions test your ability to think about the different factors which influence products.
    
- Estimation
    
    These questions usually involve a more mathematical approach to product analysis. You could be asked questions like estimate the amount of data google photos needs in a year. These questions are not so much asked because of the interviewer's interest in your ability to predict numbers, but rather to understand how you think about and contextualize the problem at hand.
    
- Technical
    
    Technical coding questions typically test your understanding of theoretical questions and/or understanding of data structures and algorithms and how to apply them in the context of a coding problem. Be prepared to answer questions about computer science concepts but to explain it at a very high level (for eg: explain recursion to a grandma). This is one of the key competencies of a PM, to explain complex technical concepts to people with varying levels of technical knowledge.
    
- Success Metrics
    
    These questions focus on what KPI (Key Performance Indicators) you can use to measure success of your product. Some examples of common KPIs in Product Management are DAU (Daily Active Users), MAU (Monthly Active Users). Example:
    
    - What are the things Netflix should measure every day?

### **PM interview books**

- [Cracking the PM Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-PM-Interview-Product-Technology/dp/0984782818/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=cracking+the+pm&qid=1592172388&sr=8-2) & [Decode and Conquer](https://www.amazon.com/Decode-Conquer-Answers-Management-Interviews/dp/0998120499/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=decode+and+conquer&qid=1592172407&sr=8-2)

### **PM technical interview and system design prep**

- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) - for Data Structures and Algorithm type of questions: focus on easy and medium type of questions. You won't be expected to code really difficult algorithm questions as a PM does not code. Interviewers want to test your basic Computer science understanding IF you have a technical background.
- [Grokking the System Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview): For more tech focused PM roles (Microsoft) be prepared to answer some simple system design or OO (Object Oriented) Design questions. The resource linked is helpful for this.
- [Gaurav Sen's YouTube channel on System design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpDnVSmNFX0&list=PLMCXHnjXnTnvo6alSjVkgxV-VH6EPyvoX) has been very helpful for system design type of questions.
- Check out [this guide on how to crack technical interviews for PM](https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/product-manager/technical-interview-questions)
- Don't go too much in depth into technical questions, the goal is to test that PMs have basic understanding of how technology works and that is what you should focus on.
