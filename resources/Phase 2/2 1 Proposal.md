# 2.1 Proposal

1. **[Understand your Company](https://community.ubcpm.club/resources/post/2-1-understand-your-company-Oc9NMUppiJEeFqC)**After deciding on a company/product, describe its vision, goals, and current value proposition.
2. **[Discovering New Markets](https://community.ubcpm.club/resources/post/discovering-new-markets-rY4EUYdw26ppiXo)**Read the following post and brainstorm which new market (user base) you want to re-purpose your product for.
3. **[Setting Objectives & Metrics](https://community.ubcpm.club/resources/post/2-1-setting-objectives-metrics-FrxCjNFLSSH1yO8)**After choosing a market, narrow in on what you want think the company should achieve when expanding their product to this market.

When finished these 3 tasks, create a post below!

\***\*2.1 Understand your Company\*\***

## **Intro to Product Strategy**

## **Understanding Product & Market**

In the video above, Dan Olsen showed this diagram:

Right now, you need to consider the company's **current** customer and **current** value proposition. **Later on,** you will describe the market (customer segment) that you want to expand to.

## **Your Task:**

- What do you think the company's vision is for their product?
- What do you think the product's current goal/trajectory is?
- What is the value that the product provides for its current segment(s)/market(s)?

You can address these 3 points in a short paragraph, bullet points, or your own format/framework.

# \***\*2.1 Discovering New Markets\*\***

Products are usually built for a specific niche market, then later **expanded** or **repurposed** as an apparent fit emerges within a new market.

Read this article from Product School on Market Opportunity Analysis, which will help you in finding your new market:

## **Your Task**

1. List out potential markets you want to break into.
2. Conduct Market Opportunity Analysis and choose a market.

# \***\*2.1 Setting Objectives & Metrics\*\***

In Phase 1, you may have considered an "objective" (top of the opportunity-solution tree) and perhaps added a qualitative metric to work towards. Now, we want to dive deeper into a term you've probably heard before: OKRs.

> OKR = Objective & Key Results

Skim through the Wikipedia page for OKRs to get an overview of its history, controversy, and *some* best practices:

## **Your Task:**

1. Choose an objective (O) that describes your aim to expand into a new market.
2. Decide on 3-5 key results (KRs), that are different ways to measure your success towards the objective.

   Note: these are not OKRs that *you* will be accomplishing. Instead, they are what you would set as key results for the **upcoming months/years** if *the company's* *product manager* were to implement your proposed strategy.
