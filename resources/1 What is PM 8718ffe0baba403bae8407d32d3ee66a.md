# What is PM?

## Introduction to PM

Product Management is a role that has no agreed upon definition—it's different at every company. With that said, according to many PM thought leaders (Marty Cagan, Teresa Torres, Ben Horowitz, Shreyas Doshi, and more), there are great ways to do product management that will yield far better outcomes than other practices.

We will focus on the best practices as described by authors, speakers, and companies in this field, while mixing in our own experience of the reality of the job.

## **The Job of a Product Manager**

A product manager "carries responsibility for overall product success," which requires knowledge in "three main spheres: **business**, **technologies**, and **user experience**" [(altexsoft.com)](https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/business/product-management-main-stages-and-product-manager-role/). This requires communication and careful balance between a number of stakeholders—users, developers, designers, sales, marketing, business leaders, and more.

[According to Marty Cagan](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/), The job of a product manager is to discover a product that is:

- valuable (for customers)
- usable (as designed by UX)
- feasible (for developers)
- viable (for the company)

With the product manager being responsible for value and viability.
